## Variable Assignment and Declaration in Oxide

Variable declaration requires type specification. Variables are immutable by default, meaning that once a variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed. 
To make variables mutable, the mut keyword must be specified.

Examples:
`let x = 3`
`let mut dist = 64`
`let pi: f64 = 3.14159`
`let y: i8 = 4`
